    title: "This minimalist and magnificent 2800 Sqft house design originates from Kerala.",
    date: "15 September, 2024",
    author: "Rio Livings",
    content: [
      "This minimalist 2800 sqft residence, located in Changanacherry, Kerala, was conceptualized with a focus on minimalistic house designs. One significant challenge encountered during the design phase was the need to balance an open floor plan with the requirement for privacy in specific areas of the residence. This was addressed by strategically staggering the layout, ensuring that the living room remains distinct from the rest of the structure while maintaining visual privacy throughout.",
      "A key architectural feature is the introduction of a courtyard at the front, facilitating cross ventilation and adding to the aesthetic appeal by visually connecting it to the terrace above. The elevation of the house is characterized by its minimalist approach, emphasizing clean lines and subtle ornamentation. Special attention was given to the design of the double-height living room, ensuring that it complements rather than detracts from the main elevation feature on the left. The exterior design palette revolves around a subtle combination of whites, greys, and wood finishes, creating a cohesive and elegant aesthetic. The residence comprises two interconnected volumes of varying heights, with a central landscape element linking them. Architectural elements such as C-shaped boxing on the right side and a corner window on the left side add visual interest while ensuring ample natural light penetrates the double-height living room.",
      "Overall, the layout of the residence prioritizes privacy by segregating semi-private areas from the main living spaces, contributing to a harmonious and functional living environment."
